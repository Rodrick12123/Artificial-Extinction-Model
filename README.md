**Specific Result Summary:** Recovery of Functional Activity (ability to perform tasks) in both Press and Pulse extinctions </br>

Simulates an ecosystem with a simple model where each species is encoded 
with a different color and can move around within a grid/ecosystem. All species
can reproduce, die, and go extinct. However, some organisms may mutate, which eventually
leads to their species evolving. Each species has a unique trait and task. Mutations can also
be influenced by an organisms ability to complete a task.
