    <p> This program evolves organisms that contain computer programs to complete 9 logic tasks. These organisms live on the toroidal grid above. 
      The white squares represent empty space and the filled in squares represent organisms. Below is a key for what each color of organism means.
    </p>

    <p> </p>
    <p> <font color="violet">Violet:</font> The most complex task the organism has solved is Equals (~(x & y)). </p>
    <p> <font color="indigo">Indigo:</font> The most complex task the organism has solved is Xor (x ^ y). </p>
    <p> <font color="blue">Blue:</font> The most complex task the organism has solved is Nor (~(x | y)). </p>
    <p> <font color="green">Green:</font> The most complex task the organism has solved is Andn (x & ~y). </p>
    <p> <font color="yellow">Yellow:</font> The most complex task the organism has solved is Or (x | y). </p>
    <p> <font color="orange">Orange:</font> The most complex task the organism has solved is Orn (x | ~y). </p>
    <p> <font color="red">Red:</font> The most complex task the organism has solved is And (x & y). </p>
    <p> <font color="maroon">Maroon:</font> The most complex task the organism has solved is Nand (~(x & y)). </p>
    <p> <font color="grey">Grey:</font> The most complex task the organism has solved is Not (~x). </p>
    <p> <font color="black">Black:</font> The organism has not solved any tasks. </p>

    <p> Our program is attempting to replicate the results of <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/597228">this paper</a>. 
      We are testing the ability of organisms to solve tasks before and after a pulse extinction event (an extinction event that occurs in one instance).
      Our pulse extinction event kills off 99.9% of the population of organisms at random and occurs at time instance 100,000. We are primarily interested in whether
      or not the post extinction population can grow back and return to the previous functional output (total tasks solved) as before.
      In the paper, functional output is able to recover fairly quickly after a pulse extinction. Our program displays similar results.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Expanding upon the paper, our team has implemented the option for the organisms to move and reproduce by pseudo-sexual reproduction.
      In this case, organisms who move to the same grid position would be able to reproduce with each other. 
      The genetic makeup of the offspring would only be dependent on one of the parents so, while reproduciton is dependent on interactions 
      between organisms, it is not fully sexual reproduction. To enable pseudo-sexual reproduction, set the sr slider to 1. 
      Feel free to play around with our other sliders and click on their names for more information about what they control.
      Some fun variations that may alter the recovery of functional output could be to vary the mutation rate or change
      the size and dimensions of the world.
